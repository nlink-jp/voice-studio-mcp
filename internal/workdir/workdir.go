// Package workdir resolves the directory one MCP call writes into — the
// caller's work directory, not this server's — and holds the blacklist of
// locations a caller may never point a tool at.
//
// The value is per session and per calling runtime, so the server cannot know
// it; only the caller can. Of the channels a runtime could use, the per-call
// argument is the only one all four of our callers have: MCP roots come back
// empty from Codex and carry only the project directory from Claude Code, and
// Codex strips the environment before spawning a server, so a `${...}`
// expansion in a registration entry never arrives. The `_meta` key is the
// second channel, for the runtimes we write ourselves: they can set it on
// every tools/call without knowing any tool's schema.
//
// There is deliberately no third. A server-chosen default is readable by the
// caller only by coincidence, and when it is not, the call still succeeds and
// returns a path to a file the caller cannot open.
//
